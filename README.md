# Unit Test, test

So, it seems that projects targetting Visual Basic have lost the ability to show the context menu itme to "Create Unit Tests", even when the same host can create unit tests for c#

This is an example project purely for demostrating this on [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/134709/create-unit-tests-context-menu-option-missing-in-v-1.html)
